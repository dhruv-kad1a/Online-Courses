# 📊 **Online Courses Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)**
## 📌** Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing Online Courses Data for an EdTech startup to uncover insights that can help optimize recorded lecture offerings. Using Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard that highlights course categories, viewer engagement, skills demand, instructors, and language preferences.
The insights will guide the startup in identifying growth opportunities, improving course strategy, and enhancing learner engagement.

## 📝 **Problem Statement**
The EdTech startup has collected data from multiple platforms but needs a structured analysis to:
1) Identify trends in course categories, sub-categories, and course types.
2) Understand viewer engagement across categories, sub-categories, and languages.
3) Recognize in-demand skills relevant to the job market.
4) Examine language distribution and preferences.
5) Assess the impact of subtitles on engagement.
6) Find top instructors by category and sub-category.
7) Explore how course duration and skills offered affect viewership.
A Power BI dashboard was built to deliver actionable insights in these areas.
